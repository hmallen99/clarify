## Current mainstream architectures for EEG data representation

A rise in the demand for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems has driven the development of a variety of paradigms used to perform effective feature extraction from obtained cortical sensory data, in particular EEG recordings. Some of the biggest challenges in representing EEG are the relatively large variance between different subjects and recording sessions, and the inherent noisiness of the data ([Bashivan et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06448)). A survey of recently developed mainstream methods suggests that there are two steps commonly adopted in arriving at locally optimal mappings of EEG, namely the following:  

1. The preprocessing of EEG data using well-defined mathematical transformations, while *incuring only a minimal loss in features unique to EEG*, and  
2. The usage of some machine learning method that is optimized for the data resulting from the transformations in the previous step.  

A naive approach is to simply extract and analyze frequency information in the EEG data. ([Birjandtalab et al., 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7590826)) performed Power Spectral Density extraction from the raw signal, and then used t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ([t-SNE](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf)) to obtain a clustering of the frequency vectors. Such a clustering could then be used in conjunction with machine learning methods to discriminate between different classes.  

However, this most simplistic approach disregards temporal and spatial information, which may be crucial to distinguishing between fine details within one subject. A paradigm that largely preserves the temporal information of cortical data is to convert the EEG signal from its original time series form into another one that preserves to some degree a temporal correlation. For such a purpose, some commonly used transformations are the Short-Time Fourier Transform ([Thiyagarajan et al., 2017](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8257016)) and the Wavelet Transform ([Pandey et al., 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-7641-1_10)). Other architectures that incorporated signal processing as their first step include ([Ashford et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29933-0_37)) and ([Bashivan et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1602/1602.00985.pdf)). These signal processing techniques yielded matrices with both frequency and temporal components, which were usually then fed into Deep Neural Networks for learning of the representation space.  

A more holistic approach to the various features of EEG involves considering the spatial distribution of channels. For example, ([Robinson et al., 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8914184)) applied frequency decomposition of the EEG signals, which was followed by spatial filtering of the data via a Common Spatial Pattern algorithm ([Ang et al., 2011](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/48371494/Filter_Bank_Common_Spatial_Pattern_FBCS20160827-9135-z27nd8.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DFilter_Bank_Common_Spatial_Pattern_FBCSP.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20200202%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200202T235129Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=1d31faf9fc88c44172862dbaf7b2758a5a232047f04c5486612e95ab97784b72)). This would generate two-dimensional inputs that could be used to train a Convolutional Neural Network or the like. Another successful architecture ([Bashivan et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06448)) employed a topology-preserving projection of electrode locations onto a 2-dimensional plane to generate spatial activity snapshots in time. These activity maps were then fed into a Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Network.  

From this brief overview, it can be seen that models with rising dimensionality may be able to incorporate more domains of the EEG data (eg. frequency, time, and space components), and that there is still a need to develop better (lossless or loss-minimizing) transformations from raw EEG to formats readily adaptable for machine learning training.
